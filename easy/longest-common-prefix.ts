/* This function finds the longest common prefix among an array of strings.
 *
 * Solution:
 * 1. If the input array is empty, return an empty string.
 * 2. Initialize an empty string `prefix` to hold the common prefix.
 * 3. Iterate character by character over the first string.
 * 4. For each character, compare it with the corresponding character in all other strings.
 * 5. If a mismatch is found or the end of any string is reached, return the current `prefix`.
 *
 * This is a vertical scanning approach â€” characters are compared column by column.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string.
 * Space Complexity: O(m), since the prefix can grow up to the length of the shortest string.
