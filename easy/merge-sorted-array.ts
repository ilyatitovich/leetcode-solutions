/**
 * This function merges two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` into a single sorted array in-place.
 * The result is stored in `nums1`, which has enough space to hold the elements of both arrays.
 *
 * Problem:
 * - `nums1` has length `m + n`, where the first `m` elements are the actual values and the rest are zeros.
 * - `nums2` has `n` elements.
 * - You must merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array, modifying `nums1` in-place.
 *
 * Solution (Two-Pointer from the End):
 * 1. Use three pointers:
 *    - `p1` at the end of the valid part of `nums1` (index `m - 1`)
 *    - `p2` at the end of `nums2` (index `n - 1`)
 *    - `p` at the very end of `nums1` (index `m + n - 1`)
 * 2. Compare `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`, and place the larger value at `nums1[p]`.
 * 3. Move the pointers accordingly and repeat until either array is fully merged.
 * 4. If there are leftover elements in `nums2`, copy them into `nums1`.
 *    - No need to handle leftovers in `nums1`â€”theyâ€™re already in place.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(m + n), each element is visited once.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), in-place merge with constant extra space.
